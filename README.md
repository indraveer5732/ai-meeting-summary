This project is an AI-powered web app that generates meeting summaries and CRM-style notes from **text input**. Paste your meeting transcript or notes, and the system will extract a clear summary, key decisions, and follow-ups.

##  Project Overview

Instead of uploading audio, users paste meeting transcripts or manually enter meeting notes. The system uses OpenAI's GPT model to produce:

- A short meeting summary
- Key action points and decisions
- Follow-up tasks in CRM format

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT (text analysis and summarization)
